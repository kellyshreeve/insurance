# Project Overview

This repository hosts an in-depth analysis of ride-share customer behavior in Chicago and includes descriptive statistics, data visualizations, and hypothesis tests on data from competitors in the area. This data science project was conducted for Zuber, a new ride share company launching in Chicago, with the purpose of finding which companies are top competitors, which neighborhoods are most popular for drop offs, and whether there is a difference in trip length on rainy days and sunny days.

# Data

## Source Data

sql_result_01.csv
  * *company_name*: taxi company name
  * *trips_amount*: the number of rides for each taxi company on November 15-16, 2017  

sql_result_04.csv
  * *dropoff_location_name*: Chicago neighborhoods where rides ended
  * *average_trips*: the average number of rides that ended in each neighborhood in November 2017  

sql_result_07.csv
  * *start_ts*: picup date and time
  * *weather_conditions*: weather conditions at the moment the ride started
  * *duration_seconds*: ride duration in seconds

## Data Acquisition

The data were retrieved through HTML parsing and SQL queries of a large database provided by TripleTen. 

## Data Preprocessing

Data were checked for missing values and duplicates. None were found and no imputation was necessary.
